<!--Here every paragraph<p> has font-family property by using p{} we can apply a same 
property to all the paragraphs. very useful and makes our code look clean-->
<!--here we see that the paragraphs are getting targeted by two kinds of styles 
there exists a priority on here HTML uses the one from which style  that is more 
specific so p{} has less priority than .Title{} so the styles in .Title{}
gets executed first-->
<!--we use span element here to work on a specific segment of a text line 
there are other tags like strong and u tag but both of them come with their 
unique styles only span element tag deosn't have style of it's own 
we can modify it however we want.-->
<!--here we used google fonts to bring more fonts to our code
writing all thsi header lines unlocks more kinds of fonts we can use if use 
<!DOCTYPE html> it tells the browser to use the latest version and it enables us
to use more fonts then we could ever imagine
